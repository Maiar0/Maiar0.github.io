            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                I am Dennis Ward II, a passionate and self-driven software developer who has spent nearly a decade exploring various aspects of programming. 
                My journey began with reverse engineering and game modifications, particularly developing mods for DayZ, which sparked my interest in coding. 
                Over the years, I have experimented with different programming languages and technologies, gradually building my skills before formally pursuing 
                a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering. I bring strong problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and a continuous 
                drive for innovation to every project I undertake.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                My professional background blends leadership, problem-solving, and software development. As a Process Technician at Quantum Plastics, 
                I developed strong troubleshooting skills, optimized manufacturing workflows, and ensured production efficiency while supervising teams and 
                managing schedules. In a leadership role, I coordinated operations as a Shift Lead, further honing my organizational abilities and ability to adapt under pressure. 
                Beyond manufacturing, my passion for technology led me to game modification and software development. I founded and managed a gaming community, 
                where I designed and delivered commissioned mods for DayZ, refining my project management, scripting, and software engineering skills. 
                My technical journey evolved from reverse engineering and scripting to working on 3D graphics with OpenGL, AI-driven pathfinding, and database-driven applications while being educated.
                This combination of leadership, adaptability, and technical expertise has equipped me with a well-rounded skill set that I continue to expand as I pursue a 
                Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering.
