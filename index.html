            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Before enrolling in my Computer Science program, I was already well-versed in programming, 
                understanding how to structure applications and solve complex problems efficiently. My academic 
                journey has reinforced my knowledge by exposing me to structured processes, industry-standard 
                methodologies, and professional development tools. While I have always had strong problem-solving 
                skills, my coursework introduced me to systematic software development practices and security 
                principles that were new to me. The creation of my ePortfolio has allowed me to refine my technical 
                skills and demonstrate my growth in software engineering, security, and database management. 
                This professional self-assessment reflects on my experiences, key learning moments, and projects 
                that illustrate my readiness for the industry.
            </p>

            <h3>Academic and Professional Growth</h3>
            <p>
                My coursework has expanded my perspective on software development by introducing structured 
                development cycles, secure coding principles, and industry best practices. Courses such as 
                CS240 (Software Development Processes) helped me understand systematic approaches to software 
                engineering, while CS320 and CS405 (Secure Coding and Unit Testing) emphasized writing secure 
                and maintainable code. My ongoing CS465 MEAN project has further enhanced my knowledge of 
                full-stack web development, applying JavaScript frameworks and database interactions in a structured 
                manner. Additionally, my OpenGL project required optimizing rendering calculations to maintain 
                high frame rates, reinforcing my understanding of efficient computation.
            </p>

            <h3>Collaboration in a Team Environment</h3>
            <p>
                Collaboration was not a significant aspect of my academic experience due to the nature of the 
                program. However, my professional background has provided ample experience working in team-based 
                environments. As a Process Technician at Quantum Plastics, I was responsible for troubleshooting 
                manufacturing processes and ensuring efficiency, which required constant collaboration with engineering 
                teams and leadership. Additionally, I gained experience working with stakeholders while freelancing as 
                a DayZ mod developer, where I engaged with users to understand requirements and improve functionality. 
                My StockSense project illustrates my awareness of the importance of collaborative environmentsâ€”while 
                currently developed as a standalone application, its real potential lies in being a multi-user system, 
                requiring a team-based approach to fully scale.
            </p>

            <h3>Communication with Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>
                Effective communication is essential in software development, and I have refined my ability to document 
                and articulate technical solutions. My coursework in CS240 (Software Development Processes) emphasized 
                working with stakeholders, product owners, and team members throughout a software development lifecycle. 
                In CS320 and CS405, I learned the importance of clear documentation for secure coding and unit tests. 
                In Enhancement Two of StockSense, I documented search optimization techniques, transitioning from O(n) 
                linear search to O(1) HashMap retrieval, ensuring that technical decisions were clearly conveyed. 
                Similarly, my CS465 MEAN project requires consistent documentation to ensure smooth API development 
                and database integration. These experiences have reinforced my ability to communicate effectively with 
                developers and non-technical stakeholders alike.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
                My ability to design efficient data structures and algorithms has been a key focus throughout my projects. 
                In Enhancement Two of StockSense, I replaced inefficient list-based searching with dual HashMaps, 
                significantly improving search performance. Additionally, my OpenGL project required implementing optimized 
                data handling for rendering 3D objects, managing memory efficiently, and applying transformations in a 
                structured manner. My Pong and Snake applications further refined my ability to write optimized code, as 
                frame rate considerations required efficient calculations and streamlined logic. These experiences have 
                solidified my ability to apply algorithmic principles in practical applications, balancing performance 
                considerations with usability.
            </p>

            <h3>Software Engineering and Database Management</h3>
            <p>
                My academic journey has deepened my understanding of scalable software architectures and database management. 
                Courses such as CS240 introduced me to systematic development methodologies, while CS465 provided hands-on 
                experience with the MEAN stack, integrating MongoDB with front-end frameworks. In Enhancement Three of 
                StockSense, I transitioned from local SQLite storage to a Supabase cloud-based backend, allowing multi-user 
                access and secure authentication. This project required API integration, query optimization, and database 
                security enhancements, all of which are critical to designing robust applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Security has been one of the most valuable areas of learning for me, as I had little prior experience in 
                this domain before my coursework. In CS320 and CS405, I learned best practices for secure coding and unit 
                testing, ensuring applications are resistant to vulnerabilities. These principles were applied in 
                Enhancement Three of StockSense, where I replaced insecure credential storage with hashed password 
                authentication in Supabase. Additionally, I have implemented secure API interactions in my CS465 MEAN 
                project, ensuring that data transfers follow industry security standards. Security remains an area of 
                ongoing learning for me, and I am eager to continue expanding my expertise in this field.
            </p>

            <h3>Integration of Artifacts in the Portfolio</h3>
            <p>
                StockSense serves as the cornerstone of my ePortfolio, demonstrating my growth in software engineering, 
                database management, and security. Originally developed as an inventory management application, it has 
                undergone multiple enhancements to improve performance, scalability, and security. The first major 
                improvement focused on modular UI design, introducing DbSelectionView and SearchViewActivity to separate 
                concerns and improve maintainability. The second enhancement optimized search functionality, replacing 
                inefficient list-based searching with dual HashMaps, allowing constant-time ID lookups and more efficient 
                name-based searches. The final enhancement transitioned StockSense from a local SQLite database to 
                Supabase, enabling multi-user access, authentication, and secure data management.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                My Computer Science program and the development of my ePortfolio have strengthened my problem-solving skills 
                and exposed me to professional methodologies. While I entered the program with programming experience, formal 
                education has refined my approach to software engineering, database management, security, and algorithmic 
                problem-solving. Security, in particular, has been a major area of growth for me, and I look forward to 
                continuing my learning in this field. These skills, along with my ability to communicate effectively and 
                develop scalable applications, position me for success in the industry. I look forward to leveraging my 
                experience and technical knowledge in future professional endeavors.
