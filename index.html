            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                Before enrolling in my Computer Science program, I had a solid foundation in programming, 
                application structuring, and problem-solving. My academic journey reinforced these skills by introducing 
                structured software development processes, industry methodologies, and security principles. 
                Through my ePortfolio, I have demonstrated my growth in software engineering, security, and database management.
            </p>

            <h3>Academic and Professional Growth</h3>
            <p>
                My coursework has expanded my knowledge of systematic development cycles, secure coding principles, and best practices. 
                Courses like CS240 (Software Development Processes) introduced structured approaches, while CS320 and CS405 
                emphasized secure coding and unit testing. Additionally, my CS465 MEAN project strengthened my understanding 
                of full-stack web development, and my OpenGL project refined my ability to optimize rendering calculations.
            </p>

            <h3>Communication and Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
                Although my academic experience was largely independent, my professional roles required collaboration. 
                As a Process Technician at Quantum Plastics, I worked closely with engineering teams to troubleshoot manufacturing 
                processes. In my freelance mod development for DayZ, I engaged with users to refine features based on feedback. 
                My StockSense project, while currently a standalone system, highlights my understanding of collaborative 
                development, as future iterations will require multi-user support.
            </p>

            <h3>Technical Skills and Security Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                I have refined my data structures and algorithm design skills through various projects, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancing StockSense's search functionality with HashMaps, improving lookup efficiency.</li>
                <li>Optimizing OpenGL rendering performance for smoother frame rates.</li>
                <li>Developing Pong and Snake games with structured logic for optimized real-time performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Security has been a major area of growth for me. In CS320 and CS405, I learned secure coding practices 
                and applied them in StockSense Enhancement Three, replacing insecure credential storage with hashed authentication 
                in Supabase. My CS465 MEAN project further reinforced secure API handling and database protections.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Artifact: StockSense</h3>
            <p>
                StockSense serves as the cornerstone of my portfolio, demonstrating my evolution in software engineering 
                and database management. Key enhancements include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Refactoring the UI for modular design.</li>
                <li>Replacing inefficient searches with dual HashMaps for constant-time lookups.</li>
                <li>Transitioning from SQLite to Supabase, introducing multi-user support and authentication.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                My Computer Science program has strengthened my problem-solving abilities, software engineering skills, 
                and security expertise. While I entered the program with prior experience, this journey refined my 
                approach to database management, system architecture, and secure development. These skills, 
                combined with my ability to communicate and collaborate, position me for continued success in the industry.
