            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            
            <p>
                Throughout my Computer Science degree program, I have strengthened my expertise in software engineering, security, 
                database management, and algorithmic problem-solving, refining the skills necessary for success in the field. My coursework 
                and hands-on projects have allowed me to transition from self-taught programming to structured, industry-standard software 
                development. By compiling my ePortfolio, I have curated technical artifacts that showcase my ability to design efficient, 
                scalable, and secure applications—demonstrating my readiness to contribute to a professional team.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most impactful areas of growth has been my ability to collaborate in a development environment. While much of my 
                academic work was independent, my prior professional experience at Quantum Plastics involved troubleshooting manufacturing 
                processes alongside engineers—an experience that reinforced the importance of problem-solving in team settings. Additionally, 
                my work in freelance game modification required engaging with users to refine software based on feedback. These experiences, 
                along with my StockSense project—where I implemented multi-user authentication and cloud database integration—demonstrate my 
                ability to build software that supports collaborative environments.
            </p>

            <p>
                Technical communication has been another critical skill developed during my coursework. In Enhancement One of StockSense, 
                I structured and documented a modular UI, ensuring the design followed best practices and could be maintained by future developers. 
                In Enhancement Two, I optimized search functionality, transitioning from an O(n) linear search to a dual HashMap approach 
                (O(1) for ID lookups). My SearchHashMapsAnalysis document outlined these algorithmic improvements with detailed technical breakdowns. 
                Additionally, while integrating Supabase authentication in Enhancement Three, I utilized Postman for API testing, documenting database 
                interactions to ensure seamless security implementation.
            </p>

            <p>
                My coursework has reinforced foundational computer science principles, including data structures and algorithms, software engineering 
                methodologies, and secure development practices. My ability to apply these concepts is evident in my OpenGL project, where I developed 
                3D rendering optimizations, and in my CS465 MEAN stack project, where I built a full-stack web application integrating MongoDB, Express, 
                Angular, and Node.js. These projects highlight my adaptability in both frontend and backend development.
            </p>

            <p>
                Security has been a primary focus in my recent work. In Enhancement Three, I replaced insecure credential storage (SharedPreferences) 
                with hashed password authentication, ensuring user data protection. My knowledge of secure API interactions, database management, 
                and authentication protocols continues to expand, making security-conscious development a core aspect of my approach.
            </p>

            <p>
                My ePortfolio is a reflection of my growth as a developer. Each artifact showcases a progression in technical ability, problem-solving 
                skills, and adaptability to real-world software challenges. From database optimizations to modular software design, these projects highlight 
                the depth of my computer science expertise. More importantly, they illustrate my commitment to continuous learning, professional development, 
                and delivering efficient, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I look forward to applying these skills in a dynamic development environment where I can contribute technical expertise, problem-solving 
                skills, and a security-first mindset to innovative projects.
