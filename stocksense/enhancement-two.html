            <p>
                Enhancement Two focused on optimizing StockSense's search functionality to improve performance and scalability. 
                Originally developed in CS360, the application relied on list-based searching (O(n)), which caused slowdowns as the dataset grew. 
                This enhancement introduced a dual HashMap approach, significantly improving search speed and system efficiency.
            </p>

            <h3>Algorithmic Improvements</h3>
            <p>
                To optimize search performance, I implemented two HashMaps:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>itemIdMap:</strong> Maps unique item IDs for O(1) retrieval.</li>
                    <li><strong>itemNameMap:</strong> Stores lowercase item names for case-insensitive lookups.</li>
                </ul>
                Previously, the application required iterating over the entire dataset for every search (O(n)), leading to performance issues.
                With this optimized structure, ID-based searches now execute in O(1) time, while name-based searches remain O(n * m) but are still 
                more efficient than the original full list iteration.
            </p>

            <h3>Enhancements to SearchViewActivity</h3>
            <p>
                The filterItems() function was restructured to leverage the new HashMaps, ensuring real-time search responsiveness. 
                This refactor significantly improved query execution times, especially for large datasets.
            </p>

            <h3>Further Optimization Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                While this enhancement significantly improved efficiency, I explored future optimizations:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trie (Prefix Tree):</strong> Could reduce name search complexity to O(m) by organizing words in a hierarchical structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>SQLite Full-Text Search (FTS5):</strong> Would enable indexed text searches, improving query performance to near O(1).</li>
                </ul>
                These approaches provide potential next steps for further improving StockSense's scalability.
            </p>

            <h3>Technical Skills Demonstrated</h3>
            <p>
                This enhancement showcases several key software engineering principles:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Structures & Algorithm Optimization:</strong> Transitioned from O(n) list searches to O(1) HashMap lookups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Maintainability:</strong> Refactored `SearchViewActivity` for better modularity and performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Query Processing:</strong> Restructured filterItems() function for faster real-time searching.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability Considerations:</strong> Evaluated Trie and SQLite FTS5 for future enhancements.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges & Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Debugging search performance issues was a major challenge, as legacy code dependencies made restructuring difficult. 
                I utilized Postman to test API calls, which streamlined debugging and improved database interaction reliability. 
                Additionally, balancing memory usage (HashMaps) vs. query efficiency reinforced my ability to analyze computational trade-offs.
            </p>

            <h3>Course Outcomes Addressed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Problem-Solving:</strong> Applied efficient data structures to improve search performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Software Engineering Best Practices:</strong> Refactored code for maintainability and efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Communication:</strong> Documented search optimizations in SearchHashMapsAnalysis.</li>
            </ul>
