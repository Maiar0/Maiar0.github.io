            <h2>Employing Strategies for Building Collaborative Environments</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most impactful improvements in Enhancement Three was transitioning StockSense from a single-user 
                application with a local SQLite database to a multi-user cloud-based system with Supabase. This enhancement 
                enables real-time inventory management, allowing multiple users to collaboratively track stock levels, reduce 
                discrepancies, and improve decision-making. By designing a shared database infrastructure, I supported organizational 
                decision-making by ensuring that team members always have access to the most up-to-date inventory data, reducing 
                miscommunication and errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, in Enhancement One, I implemented CSV import/export functionality, which enables users to transfer 
                inventory data between StockSense and external tools like Excel. This enhanced collaboration by allowing teams to 
                analyze data externally, making informed business decisions based on accurate reports. These enhancements demonstrate 
                my ability to design computing solutions that support collaborative environments, ensuring that StockSense can function 
                effectively in team-based inventory management settings.
            </p>

            <h2>Professional Quality Oral, Written, and Visual Communication</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout all enhancements, I placed a strong emphasis on clear, professional documentation and structured 
                technical explanations. In Enhancement One, I provided detailed function-level commenting and a workflow diagram 
                that visually represents the application’s architecture. These materials ensure that future developers and stakeholders 
                can understand and modify the application as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Enhancement Two, I documented search optimization techniques, outlining the shift from O(n) linear search 
                to O(1) HashMap-based retrieval. I produced a SearchHashMapsAnalysis document, which provides a structured breakdown 
                of algorithmic complexity and potential improvements. This level of documentation ensures that technical decisions 
                are well-communicated to developers and stakeholders, improving project maintainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, in Enhancement Three, I utilized Postman to test and document API responses when integrating Supabase. 
                This structured approach ensured that authentication and database interactions were well-documented and easy to debug, 
                demonstrating strong technical communication skills in API integration.
            </p>

            <h2>Designing and Evaluating Computing Solutions Using Algorithmic Principles</h2>
            <p>
                A key improvement in Enhancement Two was the optimization of search functionality, where I replaced a list-based 
                search (O(n)) with a dual HashMap approach (O(1) ID lookups and O(n*m) name searches). This design significantly 
                improved efficiency, reducing latency for larger datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further evaluate and improve search performance, I considered two additional enhancements: implementing a Trie 
                (Prefix Tree) for prefix-based name searches, reducing lookup complexity to O(m), and leveraging SQLite Full-Text 
                Search (FTS5) for database-backed indexed queries, further improving search speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This enhancement demonstrates my ability to design, analyze, and refine computing solutions, ensuring that algorithmic 
                principles are effectively applied to real-world problems. The trade-offs considered—balancing memory usage (HashMaps) 
                versus query efficiency (FTS5)—reflect my ability to manage computational trade-offs in algorithm design.
            </p>

            <h2>Applying Well-Founded and Innovative Techniques in Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                Each enhancement showcases my ability to apply modern software development tools and techniques. In Enhancement One, 
                I improved StockSense’s modularity by introducing DbSelectionView and SearchViewActivity, adhering to separation of 
                concerns and ensuring that each component focused solely on its intended function. This structured approach enhances 
                scalability and maintainability, aligning with industry best practices in software engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Enhancement Three, I transitioned StockSense from a local SQLite database to Supabase, a cloud-based backend that 
                enables remote database access and authentication. This required integrating Retrofit for API calls, optimizing query 
                performance, and ensuring that data remained synchronized across multiple users. Debugging database connectivity issues, 
                analyzing server vs. client-side sorting, and balancing query efficiency vs. real-time responsiveness reinforced my 
                ability to implement scalable, production-ready database solutions.
            </p>

            <h2>Developing a Security Mindset in Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                Security was a critical focus in Enhancement Three, where I replaced insecure credential storage (SharedPreferences) 
                with hashed password authentication in Supabase. This enhancement mitigates potential security risks, ensuring that 
                sensitive user credentials are encrypted and securely managed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, while exploring database optimizations in Enhancement Two, I evaluated the security implications of 
                search indexing and query structures, ensuring that potential SQL injection vulnerabilities were mitigated. By 
                considering security risks in search optimization, I demonstrated an ability to anticipate and address adversarial 
                exploits in database queries.
