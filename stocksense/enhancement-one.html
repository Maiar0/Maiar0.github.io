            <p>
                Enhancement One for the StockSense application focused on implementing modular and focused views, 
                specifically the `DbSelectionView` and `SearchViewActivity`. The `DbSelectionView` allows users to select 
                the database they want to interact with, while the `SearchViewActivity` provides an interface for viewing 
                and searching items in the selected database. This modular approach adheres to the principle of separation 
                of concerns, making the application more maintainable and scalable.
            </p>

            <p>
                The inclusion of CSV import/export functionality significantly enhances the application's usability. 
                Using the OpenCSV library, I implemented efficient data parsing and exporting, enabling seamless 
                data transfer between StockSense and external tools like Excel. Additionally, integrating `RecyclerView` 
                ensures a dynamic, user-friendly interface that scales efficiently.
            </p>

            <h3>Code Documentation and Maintainability</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout the enhancement, I prioritized clear documentation and maintainable code structures. 
                Every function and variable has been thoroughly commented to ensure readability and future extensibility. 
                Additionally, I created a workflow diagram to visually represent the application's design, further 
                supporting future development efforts.
            </p>

            <h3>Error Handling and Security Improvements</h3>
            <p>
                Robust error handling mechanisms were integrated to ensure user-friendly feedback during CSV operations 
                and database interactions. Additionally, I removed the password feature from this phase to simplify UI 
                development while planning for a more secure authentication mechanism in future iterations.
            </p>

            <h3>Collaborative Features and Impact</h3>
            <p>
                The CSV import/export feature enhances collaboration by allowing teams to share inventory data between 
                StockSense and external analysis tools like Excel. This aligns with the goal of supporting collaborative 
                decision-making and efficient inventory management.
            </p>

            <h3>Technical Skills Demonstrated</h3>
            <p>
                This enhancement demonstrates a range of technical skills, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Android UI Design:</strong> Used `RecyclerView` to create a dynamic, user-friendly interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Implemented CSV import/export functionality using OpenCSV.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Handling & Security:</strong> Integrated structured exception handling to improve user feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Managed enhancements with Git branches to ensure structured development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                One of the primary challenges was debugging Supabase API interactions via Retrofit. Using Postman 
                for API validation significantly improved debugging efficiency. Additionally, breaking down legacy code 
                modularization into smaller tasks streamlined the refactoring process, ensuring a smooth transition to 
                a more maintainable architecture.
            </p>

            <h3>Course Outcomes Addressed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Designing Computing Solutions:</strong> Developed a structured UI with modular components.</li>
                <li><strong>Applying Software Engineering Principles:</strong> Followed best practices in UI design and structured data management.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Communication:</strong> Documented workflow diagrams and clear function-level commenting.</li>
            </ul>
