            <p>
                The selected artifact for this enhancement is the StockSense mobile application, originally developed in CS360 for inventory management. 
                Initially, the application relied on a local SQLite database, limiting its scalability and usability in a multi-user environment. 
                To improve its real-world applicability, I enhanced the project by integrating an online Supabase database, transforming it into 
                a cloud-based, multi-user system. This enhancement enables remote database access, allowing organizations to manage inventory 
                collaboratively and securely.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with modern database technologies and secure 
                authentication mechanisms. Transitioning from a local SQLite database to Supabase showcases my ability to design and implement 
                scalable cloud-based solutions. Additionally, I incorporated user authentication with hashed passwords, demonstrating secure 
                data management practices. This enhancement highlights my ability to develop robust backend architectures, utilize APIs for 
                database interactions, and handle real-world database constraints such as indexing, query optimization, and user role management.
            </p>

            <h3>Alignment with Course Outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                Through this enhancement, I successfully met several course outcomes. The transition to a hosted multi-user database supports 
                organizational decision-making by enabling multiple users to interact with shared inventory data. By implementing structured 
                documentation and API integration, I demonstrated professional technical communication skills. The adoption of Supabase and 
                Retrofit for API calls reflects my ability to design computing solutions that address real-world needs, ensuring scalability 
                and performance. Additionally, I implemented hashed passwords for user authentication, reinforcing security principles and 
                mitigating risks associated with credential storage.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges and Learning Experiences</h3>
            <p>
                The process of enhancing this application provided valuable learning experiences. Before this project, I had never connected an 
                online database to a mobile application. Setting up Supabase and integrating it with the Android application using Retrofit presented 
                challenges, particularly in managing API calls and debugging connectivity issues. To resolve these issues, I utilized Postman to test 
                endpoints and troubleshoot API responses. Additionally, I refined database queries to ensure efficient data retrieval and sorting 
                mechanisms, exploring solutions such as server-side sorting versus client-side management. This experience strengthened my understanding 
                of database architecture, API debugging, and mobile-to-backend integration.
            </p>

            <h3>Database Optimization and Sorting Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                One of the key challenges I faced was determining how and where to sort the inventory data. Initially, I considered handling sorting 
                on the client-side using a DataManager, but later explored database triggers to perform sorting upon retrieval. Due to the complexity 
                of trigger-based sorting, I am inclined to maintain client-side sorting, optimizing performance based on application needs. This decision 
                reflects my ability to assess trade-offs between database and application logic, balancing efficiency and maintainability.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact and Future Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                This enhancement represents a significant step in professionalizing the StockSense application, making it viable for real-world 
                deployment. By integrating Supabase for database hosting, Retrofit for API communication, and secure authentication, I have enhanced 
                the projectâ€™s scalability, security, and usability. Future improvements could include real-time updates, data synchronization strategies, 
                and role-based access control to further enhance functionality. The knowledge gained from this enhancement will be instrumental in future 
                software development projects, particularly those requiring backend integration, cloud databases, and mobile application security.
